This project was developed by [Magê Deungaro](https://github.com/magedeungaro), [Danilo Castro](https://github.com/danilogcastro), [Felipe Kummer](https://github.com/FsKummer) and [Débora Lee](https://github.com/deboralee) during [Le Hackathon E2E 02-2024](https://lehackatonsports.com.br/solucoes/) as one of the proposed solutions. Any inquiries, please contact us.

The goal is to interact with football club fans as if the bot was one of them, using the same language and club-specific slangs. It's more than a bot, it's that friend that understands you when your team lost an important game, or cheers with you when the team won that cup.

It is interface independent; Telegram was used for the sake of demonstration. Prompts were refined so the bot could behave exactly as we needed - as a club fan. We are aware of hallucination problems and that specific data should never go through the AI layer. However, since the project needed to be developed in less than 24 hours, we decided to focus on the bot's humanized behavior.

Also, we are aware the architecture is not ideal. In fact, we completely ignored it and treated the project as a POC. If it was to be implemented for real, we would have invested more time designing its layers.

Below, it is possible to see some real interactions with the bot. Botafogo is a Brazilian Soccer Club from Rio de Janeiro and Biriba is one of its mascots, so it made total sense for us to make the bot impersonate Biriba while talking to fans. Interactions are in Brazilian Portuguese and contain slangs.
